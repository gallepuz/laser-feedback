### Grounding the enclosure
On the front panel there is a solid copper path between the BNCs and the corner holes. The top right and bottom left can be used to ground the enclosure to the electronics within. The plated region around the input and output holes connects to the washer on the BNC connector. 

To secure grounding of the enclosure unscrew one of the corner panel screws and place a (conductive) washer.
